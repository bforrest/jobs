**About you**

You love code, learning and helping others. You've lead a small team, have designed more than one system and understand why dependency inversion is important. A `GET` request which mutates state gives you the *shivers*; You know that `PUT` and `POST` serve different purposes. You know a unit test from an integration test and what is different between Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development. A task board is not a novelty.

**About the Position**

You'll be encouraged to think outside the box and participate in discussions to help improve existing software architecture and designs. You'll as be mentoring a small team.

This is a full stack position with an Angular front end, C# on the web server for Web API and WCF end points with a SQL Server data store. You should be comfortable and competant writing code at any of these layers in the appropriate dialect - CSS, HTML, JavaScript, C#, or T-SQL.

You'll write unit tests and integration tests as new features are implemented and review code to ensure that high quality standards are respected.
