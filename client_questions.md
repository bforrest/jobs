# Client Questions

These are currently just some quick thoughts that I wanted to get out. They will need to be fleshed out fully at some point.

- Is the culture fun or serious
- Is the road to change restrictive or open
- Do they allow work from Improving/client office/home
- What is the expected work from client (implement these features, start a new project, consult on process, write documentation, etc)
- What is the expected work from Improving (set the stage for more Improvers, bring in Agile coaching, etc)
- What is the onboarding procedure (is there a plan, or will hirees be left floundering)
- Describe the typical day at the client
- Is there a supporting team in place from Improving or the client
